Research 

There are already several digital platforms that attempt to solve the problem of discovering festivals across Europe. Researching existing solutions is important in order to understand what is currently available, what works well, and where gaps still exist. This helps justify the need for the artofest.com project and ensures that its scope and objectives are realistic and relevant. 

One of the main existing platforms in this area is FestivalFinder.eu, which can be considered the primary competition for this project. 

Existing solution: FestivalFinder.eu 

FestivalFinder.eu is an online platform created by the European Festivals Association that provides a large, searchable database of festivals across Europe. The platform includes thousands of festivals from a wide range of artistic disciplines such as music, theatre, dance, literature, and street arts. Users can search and filter festivals by country, city, dates, discipline and price range. The platform is designed to serve multiple audiences such as festival visitors, organisers and journalists. 

Overall, FestivalFinder.eu functions primarily as an informational directory and networking platform rather than a planning or booking tool for end users. 

Strengths of FestivalFinder.eu 

It offers a very large database of festivals across many European countries 

It is supported by a reputable organisation, giving it credibility and trust 

It serves a wide range of stakeholders, not just festival audiences 

It promotes cultural value and quality through curated labels and initiatives 

These strengths show that there is a clear demand for a centralised festival discovery platform and confirm that the general idea behind artofest.com is valid. 

Limitations 

Despite its strengths, FestivalFinder.eu also has a number of limitations, particularly from the perspective of everyday users who are planning to attend festivals. 

The platform is heavily focused on providing large amounts of information rather than supporting personal planning. There is no built-in feature for users to create personalised schedules, save festivals to a wish list, or plan their festival experience over time. This makes it less suitable for users who want a more interactive and tailored experience. 

In addition, the user interface prioritises data and categorisation over simplicity, which may feel overwhelming to casual users. The platform also functions mainly as a web-based directory, with limited emphasis on mobile-first design or cross-platform consistency. Finally, while festival information is provided, there is little support for wider trip planning such as travel or accommodation integration. 

How artofest.com will be different 

The artofest.com project builds on the ideas used by platforms like FestivalFinder.eu but takes a more user-focused approach. Instead of acting purely as a directory, artofest.com is designed to help users actively plan and manage their festival experiences. 

Key differences include: 

A personalised planner that allows users to organise festivals and events into a schedule 

A wish list feature for saving festivals of interest 

A cleaner and more intuitive interface aimed at casual and first-time users 

Consistent functionality across both web and mobile platforms 

A system designed to support future integration with travel and accommodation APIs 

Relevance to the project 

This research supports the project’s scope and objectives by demonstrating that while festival discovery platforms already exist, they do not fully meet modern user expectations. The analysis of FestivalFinder.eu highlights that there is a clear opportunity to improve user experience, personal planning features, and cross-platform accessibility.
