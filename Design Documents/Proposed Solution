The proposed solution is to develop artofest.com which will be a cross-platform festival discovery and planning platform built using React Native. By using this it will allow us to use the same codebase for both the mobile app (iOS/Android) and the web version. This approach will support faster development and easier long-term maintenance compared to building separate applications. 

The first release will focus on delivering a responsive and user-friendly experience where users can browse and view detailed festival information in one place. Each festival profile will include key details such as the festival name, location, genre/type, dates, estimated cost, media content (such as videos) and links to official booking pages. This ensures users can compare festivals easily and access reliable booking information without needing to search across multiple websites. 

To improve on existing festival directory platforms, artofest.com will include features designed around real user needs rather than purely acting as a listing site. This includes: 

Advanced search and filters (e.g., genre, location, date range) to help users quickly find relevant festivals 

A personal planner tool where users can create and manage a festival schedule using a calendar-style view 

A wish list feature so users can save festivals they are interested in and return to them later 

A key part of the solution is making festival data easy to manage and update over time. The project will attempt to include a Content Management System (CMS) so administrators can add, edit, and remove festival entries without writing code. However, because CMS integration may be challenging due to our limited experience and time constraints, this will be treated as an optional enhancement rather than a guaranteed core requirement. 

The platform will also be designed with future expansion in mind. Once the core features are stable, the system will be prepared for future integration with travel and accommodation APIs, allowing users to view travel and hotel options linked to specific festivals. This will not be the main focus of the first release but will be considered in the architecture so it can be added later without a major rework. 

Overall, this solution aims to deliver a modern, accessible and user-focused platform that goes beyond any existing festival directories.
